//696. Count Binary Substrings

//Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.
//
//Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: "00110011"
//Output: 6
//Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
//
//Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
//
//Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
//Example 2:
//Input: "10101"
//Output: 4
//Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
//Note:
//
//s.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
//s will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.
