//160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
//Easy

//Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
//
//For example, the following two linked lists:
//
//
//begin to intersect at node c1.
//
// 
//
//Example 1:
//
//
//Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
//Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
//Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
// 
//
//Example 2:
//
//
//Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
//Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
//Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
// 
//
//Example 3:
//
//
//Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
//Output: null
//Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
//Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
// 
//
//Notes:
//
//If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
//The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
//You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
//Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
