//121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
//Easy
//
//3330

//Favorite
//
//Share
//Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
//
//If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
//
//Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
//Output: 5
//Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
//             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
