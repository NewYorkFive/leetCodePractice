//The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
//
//The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
//
//Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).
//
//In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
//
//
//
//Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.
//
//For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
//
//-2 (K)    -3    3
//-5    -10    1
//10    30    -5 (P)
//
//
//Note:
//
//The knight's health has no upper bound.
//Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
