//392. Is Subsequence
//Easy
//
//1263
//

//
//Add to List
//
//Share
//Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
//
//A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
//
//Follow up:
//If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
//
//Credits:
//Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
//Output: true
//Example 2:
//
//Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
//Output: false
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//0 <= s.length <= 100
//0 <= t.length <= 10^4
//Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.
