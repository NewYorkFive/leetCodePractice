//Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
//
//You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
//
//Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
//
//For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
//
//Note:
//
//A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
//Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
//The input array words contains at least one word.
//Example 1:
//
//Input:
//words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
//maxWidth = 16
//Output:
//[
//   "This    is    an",
//   "example  of text",
//   "justification.  "
//]
//Example 2:
//
//Input:
//words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
//maxWidth = 16
//Output:
//[
//  "What   must   be",
//  "acknowledgment  ",
//  "shall be        "
//]
//Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
//             because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
//             Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
//Example 3:
//
//Input:
//words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
//         "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
//maxWidth = 20
//Output:
//[
//  "Science  is  what we",
//  "understand      well",
//  "enough to explain to",
//  "a  computer.  Art is",
//  "everything  else  we",
//  "do                  "
