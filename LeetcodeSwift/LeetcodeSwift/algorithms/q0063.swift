//A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
//
//The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
//
//Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
//
//
//
//An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
//
//Note: m and n will be at most 100.
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input:
//[
//  [0,0,0],
//  [0,1,0],
//  [0,0,0]
//]
//Output: 2
//Explanation:
//There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
//There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
//1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
//2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
