//Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
//
//A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
//
//
//
//If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
//Example 3:
//
//Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
//Output: 0
//Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= text1.length <= 1000
//1 <= text2.length <= 1000
//The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
