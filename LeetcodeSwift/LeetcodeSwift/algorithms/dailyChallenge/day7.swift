//Counting Elements
//Solution
//Given an integer array arr, count element x such that x + 1 is also in arr.
//
//If there're duplicates in arr, count them seperately.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: arr = [1,2,3]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there's no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.
//Example 3:
//
//Input: arr = [1,3,2,3,5,0]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: 0, 1 and 2 are counted cause 1, 2 and 3 are in arr.
//Example 4:
//
//Input: arr = [1,1,2,2]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: Two 1s are counted cause 2 is in arr.
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= arr.length <= 1000
//0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
